### 1. Sentiment Analysis (End-to-End Pipeline)
**Description:**  
Collects, cleans, analyzes, and visualizes user reviews from Google Play Store apps. Supports multi-class sentiment classification (e.g., Positive, Neutral, Negative).

**Tech Stack:**  
`Python`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `Streamlit`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

**Problem:**  
App developers receive thousands of reviews but struggle to identify trends or UX issues.

**Solution:**  
An end-to-end pipeline that scrapes, analyzes, and visualizes sentiment trends across app categories.

### 2. Fine-Tuning LLaMA 3.1 with Unsloth for Text-to-SQL
**Description:**  
This project fine-tunes the unsloth/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B model using the GretelAI synthetic text-to-SQL dataset. Uses Low Rank Adaption technique to reduce the computational cost

**Tech Stack:**  
`Python`, `Transformers`, `Unsloth`, `LLaMA 3`, `Datasets`, `LoRA`, `Text-to-SQL`, `Colab`

**Problem:**  
Many Text-to-SQL solutions require large compute or training from scratch.

**Solution:**  
The goal is to help the model generate accurate SQL queries with explanations based on natural language prompts and database descriptions.

### 3. Regime Switching Forecasting Engine
**Description:**  
Detects market regimes using engineered features from time series data and helps with forecasting. This is my one of the most advanced project and also in progress 

**Tech Stack:**  
`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `custom feature engineering`

**Problem:**  
Financial markets don‚Äôt behave the same all the time. Standard models assume stationarity, but I have used the volatility (the random spikes you see in the graphs)

**Solution:**  
Switching regimes framework allows building dynamic models that adapt to market context.

### 4. Career Crawler
**Description:**  
A powerful job search application built with Streamlit that scrapes job listings from multiple platforms including Indeed, LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Glassdoor, and Google Jobs.

**Tech Stack:**  
`Python`, `NLP`, `Pandas`, `Streamlit`, `JobSpy`

**Problem:**  
It‚Äôs hard to find and apply the jobs that only matter to you.

**Solution:**  
Automates fetching jobs from top job posters and make a personalized dashboard with relevant jobs.
